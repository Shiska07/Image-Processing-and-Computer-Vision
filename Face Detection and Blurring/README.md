This program uses Haar Cascade xml classifiers to detect faces from webcam feed. Not that this is face 'DETECTION' not face 'RECOGNITION'.

After the face is detected, simple image processing is applied to blur the detected faces. The harr cascade files are provided in the repo. 

Please make sure that path provided in the python script is correct before running the program.
